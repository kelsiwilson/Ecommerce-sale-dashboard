## Data cleaning & preparation
Step 1: Download the file from the link and Load and clean data location in Python.
The Location column was cleaned in Python to ensure consistency and accuracy, first identified and handled special characters (e.g., Évry, Göteborg, Créteil, São Cristóvão) by normalizing text using Unicode standardization. Inconsistent spellings and formats, such as variations of "Paris 17," were standardized by mapping them to a unified name. Extra whitespaces were removed using .str.strip(), and text was converted to title case for uniform formatting. Since there were no missing values, no imputation was needed. Finally, a verification check was performed to confirm the uniformity of location names across the dataset.
