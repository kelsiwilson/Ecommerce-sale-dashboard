By analyzing the various aspects of the sales data,
We seek to uncover trends, analyze historical data and

## Objective
This repository serves as a documentation resource to analyze product sales,

such as group category that spends more, customer satisfaction affects brand loyalty,

## Data cleaning & preparation
Step 1: Download the file from the link and Load and clean the data location in Python.
The Location column was cleaned in Python to ensure consistency and accuracy, first identified and handled special characters (e.g., Évry, Göteborg, Créteil, São Cristóvão) by normalizing text using Unicode standardization. Inconsistent spellings and formats, such as variations of "Paris 17," were standardized by mapping them to a unified name. Extra whitespaces were removed using .str.strip(), and text was converted to title case for uniform formatting. Since there were no missing values, no imputation was needed. Finally, a verification check was performed to confirm the uniformity of location names across the dataset.
Step 2: Open data in Excel and check each column and row for any errors or inconsistencies. 
Step 3: I notice on the Purchased Category, "Travel & Leisure Flights" was written as Travel & Leisure (Flights and "Packages" was written as Packages).
Step 4: WE cleaned using the find and replace method and erased the bracket.
Step 5: Create a pivot Table for Customer Satisfaction & Loyalty, Customer Product purchase by shipping preference,
Social media influence affects product purchases and rating
Step 6: Create a Dashboard in Excel using a bar chart, line chart, pie chart, Column chart etc..
